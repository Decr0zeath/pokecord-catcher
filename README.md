### how 2 run bot???
download, install the .net core runtime from [HERE](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/thank-you/dotnet-runtime-2.1.1-windows-hosting-bundle-installer)

navigate to your bot directory, open a command prompt

run this command

`dotnet PokecordCatcher.dll`

after that have the bot catch pokemans for u xd

### ok how i have the pokemon hack bot how do i filter stuff????
there are built in commands and stuff to help you do that

set OwnerID and UserbotPrefix in config.json first, YOU SHOULD HAVE IT CONFIGURED.

Add pokemon names to WhitelistedPokemon if you want to filter to certain pokemon, add guild IDs to WhitelistedGuilds if you want to limit the bot to certain servers.

### Commands

You can toggle the bot's filtering with some commands.

<prefix> is the prefix that you set for Userbot in config.json

`<prefix>status` - displays the bot's toggled properties

`<prefix>reload` - reloads config.json 

`<prefix>toggleguilds` - toggles guild whitelisting

`<prefix>togglepokemon` - toggles pokemon whitelisting


your settings will persist accross restarts
